## Professional

### Arm (2014--present)

I joined in June 2014, just after my PhD, to continue research in
computer architecture. My research mainly focuses on system
architecture. Previous projects include translation, full-system
modelling, and memory encryption & integrity.

### Uppsala University (2009--2014)

Before joining Arm, I did a PhD in Computer Architecture. This
resulted in the thesis
[Understanding Multicore Performance: Efficient Memory System Modeling and Simulation](/publications/thesis2014_sandberg.pdf)
(ISBN: 978-91-554-8922-9). The focus of the thesis was techniques for
efficient memory system modelling and performance prediction.

### Acumem AB (2007--2009)

Between my Master of Science degree in Engineering Physics and
Scientific Computing and my PhD, I briefly worked for startup Acumem
AB. The company was developing products that used statistical cache
modelling to profile applications and give developers optimisation
advise. Under the hood, an in-house dynamic binary instrumentation
framework to sample non-unique reuse distances. These profiles were
analysed using StatCache or StatStack to translate the reuse distance
profiles into cache miss probabilities. These miss probabilities could
then be assigned to specific program locations. Together with a
sampled data-flow graph, the tools suggested cache-friendly
optimisations such as data structure layout transformation or loop
transformations.

Shortly after I joined Uppsala University to work full time on a PhD
in Computer Architecture, Acumem was acquired by Rouge Wave
Software. The tool is now distributed by ParaTools as open source
available as open source (LGPL) as
[ParaTools ThreadSpotter](http://threadspotter.paratools.com/).
